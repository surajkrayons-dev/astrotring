          <p>
            Bhoomi Pujan is the Hindu ground-breaking ceremony performed before
            any new construction — a home, office, temple, or commercial
            building.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is an act of gratitude toward Mother Earth (Bhoomi Devi), seeking
            her permission and blessing before the land is disturbed. In {year},
            the auspicious muhurat for Bhoomi Pujan is calculated using the
            Panchang, the landowner's birth chart, and Vastu Shastra principles.

            What Is Bhoomi Pujan — And Why Does It Still Matter?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Before the first shovel breaks the ground. Before the concrete is
            poured. Before the walls rise — there is Bhoomi Pujan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bhoomi means earth or land, and Pujan means worship or reverence.
            Together, Bhoomi Pujan is the ritual of asking permission from the
            earth before we build upon it — acknowledging that the land is not
            merely raw material but a living entity that sustains us.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a world that moves fast and builds even faster, Bhoomi Pujan is a
            deliberate act of mindfulness. It reminds us that construction is
            not just about structures but about relationships with the land that
            supports them.

            "We don't own the earth. We borrow it. Bhoomi Pujan is the moment we
            acknowledge that borrowing — and ask, with gratitude, to be good
            custodians of what we've been given."

          </h2>

          <p>
            A Bhoomi Pujan muhurat is calculated with particular attention to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Tithi:</strong> Shukla Paksha (waxing moon) tithis are
              generally preferred; Dwitiya, Tritiya, Panchami, Saptami, Dasami,
              Trayodashi are considered auspicious.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Nakshatra:</strong> Pushya, Rohini, Hasta, Anuradha,
              Uttara Phalguni, and Uttara Ashadha are favoured for new
              construction.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Vara:</strong> Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are
              generally preferred; Monday is acceptable for residential
              buildings.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Rahu Kalam / Yamagandam:</strong> These inauspicious daily
              windows must be avoided for ground-breaking.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Lord of the Land Direction / Janma Rashi:</strong> Some
              Vastu practitioners consider which direction is supported by the
              day's planetary lord.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The astrologer will also consider the owner's Janma Rashi (moon
            sign) and Ascendant, ensuring the muhurat supports the individual
            beginning this specific construction journey.

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
            Step-by-Step: What Happens During Bhoomi Pujan
          </h2>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Site Preparation</strong> — The plot is cleaned and
              cleared. A small, sacred area — typically in the northeast or
              center of the site — is designated for the ceremony. This area is
              decorated with flowers, rangoli, and sometimes a canopy
              (shamiana).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Kalash Sthapana</strong> — A brass or copper pot (kalash)
              filled with water, mango leaves, and a coconut is installed at the
              ceremonial site. The kalash represents abundance, the earth's
              fertility, and the presence of divine energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ganesh Puja</strong> — Every construction ceremony begins
              by invoking Lord Ganesha — the remover of obstacles, the guardian
              of new beginnings. No construction project wants obstacles. This
              puja is the formal request for a clear path.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navagraha Puja</strong> — Prayers are offered to the nine
              planetary deities (Navagrahas) to neutralise any potentially
              adverse planetary influences and invite their collective support
              for the project's success.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bhoomi Devi Puja</strong> — The heart of the ceremony. The
              priest offers flowers, fruits, sacred grains, milk, and honey to
              Mother Earth — asking her permission to disturb the land,
              promising to use it well, and requesting her blessings for
              everyone who will eventually live or work in the completed
              structure.
              <br />
              <p>
                Mantras specific to Bhoomi Devi are chanted. In Vedic tradition,
                these include prayers from the Atharva Veda's Bhoomi Suktam —
                among the oldest hymns to the earth in human literature.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Havan (Sacred Fire Ritual)</strong> — A sacred fire is lit
              and oblations are made — ghee, grains, herbs, and wooden sticks —
              accompanied by Vedic mantras. The smoke rising from the havan is
              considered purifying, clearing any negative energies from the site
              and establishing a protective field around it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Symbolic Ground-Breaking</strong> — The owner, or a senior
              family member, uses a golden or silver instrument (or a decorated
              spade) to symbolically break the ground — often at the northeast
              corner of the site. This is the moment of official beginning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blessings, Prasad, and Community</strong> — The ceremony
              concludes with distribution of prasad (sacred food offering),
              blessings from priests and elders, and often a meal for all those
              gathered. Workers who will build the structure are frequently
              included and honoured — a recognition that their labour and safety
              matter.

            A good Bhoomi Pujan muhurat will usually provide a window of 1–3

            place within that window, while the actual construction work can
            continue according to your regular project schedule.

          <p>
            Every home is built twice — once in the mind, and once in the earth.
            Bhoomi Pujan is the moment between those two realities: when the
            dream is made material, when the land accepts the beginning, and
            when the people who will live within those walls first say,
            together: this is where we begin.
          </p>

            May the ground beneath your foundation be firm. May every wall you
